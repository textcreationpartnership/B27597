            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>Oliver Cromwell's GHOST, Dropt from the CLOUDS.</head>
            <p>HEY! What an Alteration's here, in this unhappy Kingdom? Here's <hi>Presbyterian</hi> against <hi>Protestant,</hi> and PAPIST against them both: Here's KNIG tugging one way; and PARLIA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MENT tugging another: Whilst the sly PAPIST leaves no Stone unturn'd to destroy both together. The Popish Irish, the Fantastical French, and the worst part of the <hi>Scotch</hi> have every one an Eye upon <hi>ENGLANDS</hi> Ruin.</p>
            <p>I have no Patience to see those FOOLS, that I so lately humbled, take such ambitious and destructive Measures? What alwayes PLOTTING? and never satisfied? and plotting alwaies against KINGs and QUEENS! Where were your Plots in my Daies? I could sit at the Helm a long time undisturb'd! The French were as calm as the <hi>Thames</hi> in the midst of Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer! I made the bloody <hi>Bog-Trotters</hi> run into Caves and Woods, and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py was he, That could rest there unseen. I made the Priests run like Chaff before the Wind, and the Jesuites were blown up like Gun-powder in the Air; The Pope was glad that he could enjoy his tripple Crown in Peace: for the very Name of CROMWEL was as dreadfull as an Army to him: But now he begins to rouze like a man from his sleep, and sends his sediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Emissaries to all the Corners of the Earth: Here's Treason discover'd, and there's Treason an Hatching; Here's a heap of Jesuites in one consult, and there's a Knot of Lords and a Pack of Knaves in another: But I see indeed you have lessned the number; for I can hear <hi>STAFFORD</hi> bellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing like a butcher'd OX; and roaring in vain for leave to make a Second Speech, or to explain his former: I can hear the Priests and Jesuites cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing their Senses for contriving such detestible Lies just at the hour of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution; and tearing their Tongues for speaking such abominable Lies: But, alas! what an inconsiderable Number are they to those as deeply con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernd in the same <hi>PLOT</hi> as themselves? They are but like a Drop to an Hogshead of Water, or like a River to the Ocean, for their Number, may be
<pb facs="tcp:196315:2"/>called <hi>Legion.</hi> Oh, that I could pick up the Crumbs of my mangled Body again, That I might set their Clock once more in order: Oh! That I might be suffered; now, to do as much for King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, as I did against King <hi>Charles</hi> the first: That I might regain my Credit: I would, not fear but be knighted for my good Service! but, in vain do I beg for a united body to this my disturbed Soul untill the Resurrection: Well, since I can give you no personal Help, dear Country-men, this I will do at a distance, Ile send you my Weekly Pacquet of Advice, to shew you the Marks and Manners of the Swarming Papists, that you may see them better than by <hi>L' Estrange</hi>'s Eyes: and, when you know them, if you will then mingle your selves with them and partake of their Society, you your selves are guilty of your own Ruine. I doubt the King will hardly hear my Doctrine, or else I would tell him, How mightily they help'd me on with his Fathers Ruine: 'Tis their Interest to weaken every opposing Power, that they at last may be sole Conquerors of the whole World. But, if my Advice may be taken, I could with His Majesty would offer up <gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">
